A React spreadsheet that displays remote data from a Google Sheets document. Users are able to filter and sort data in the view-only mode. Admins are able to add, edit and delete data in the app and see changes update in their Google Sheet. The client authenticates admins through Auth0 using serverless functions. (No public deployment)
