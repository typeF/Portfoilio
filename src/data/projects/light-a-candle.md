A online memorial to remember and honor the healthcare workers who have fallen in the line of duty while treating COVID-19 patients. Users can view memorials which are grouped by location using a map. Users can also leave messages of encouragement for those still in the fight by "lighting a candle". Winning project for React Vancouver's March 2020 Hackathon.
